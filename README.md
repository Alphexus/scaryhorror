# Horror Game Project
A horror game I worked on that I decided to open source.
Made it open source because the project failed. But this is still some of my nice works featuring a lot of cool stuff.

I used the Knit framework for the entire architecture. For user interface, I went with Roact and Rodux.

The "neat things": 
* Smooth dynamic pathfinding that can scale up to a lot of NPCs 
* Good architecture overall. Especially for front-end UI.
* Dynamic sound library called "Soundly" (which is private but the old code should still be in here. Might be a few commits behind)
* Simple, yet beautiful horror event handling system.
* Scalable and powerful interactable system
* and more!
